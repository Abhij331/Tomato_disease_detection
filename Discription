Overview
This project aims to accurately detect and classify viral diseases in tomato plants using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the ResNet50 convolutional neural network. Early identification 
of plant diseases is crucial for the agriculture industry as it helps in reducing crop losses and improves yield quality. This project provides an automated solution to detect various viral infections 
affecting tomato leaves, enabling timely intervention and better management of plant health.

Methodology
The model was developed using the ResNet50 architecture, a deep residual neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is known for its excellent performance in image recognition tasks.
The ResNet50 model was fine-tuned to classify 10 classes of tomato leaf conditions, including both healthy and disease-affected states.
Data Preparation: The dataset was organized into training and validation sets. An ImageDataGenerator was used to apply data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, zoom, and shifts, to improve the
model's generalization capability.
Model Building: The pre-trained ResNet50 model was used as the base model with its top layers removed. A custom classification head with dense layers was added on top, including global average pooling
and fully connected layers with ReLU activations, followed by a softmax output layer to classify the 10 different categories of tomato leaf conditions.
Training and Optimization: The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss. Callbacks like EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, and ReduceLROnPlateau were utilized to prevent
overfitting and improve training efficiency.
Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics, loss plots, classification reports, and a confusion matrix. The trained model was able to accurately predict the presence of diseases
in unseen tomato leaf images.
Deployment and Prediction: A custom function was developed to preprocess images from URLs, allowing for quick prediction of disease classes using the trained model. This demonstrates the potential real-world
application of the system in identifying plant diseases from field images.
